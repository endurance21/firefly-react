https://codesandbox.io/s/example-firefly-react-forked-9gsye?file=/src/App.js

## USAGE :

```js
npm i firefly-react
```

Import it into your React Project

```js
import Firefly from "firefly-react";
```
in app.js ( 1 line code and done üòé) :

```JSX


   <Firefly
      canvasWidth={200}  // you can choose any positive width suitable for your purpose
      canvasHeight={300} // you can choose any positive height suitable for your purpose
   />

```

## Customizations 

### Colors
One can add an Array of colors and the fireflies thus generated will get its color(can be hex-code or in rbga format) from this array in a random fashion :

```js
const colors = ["Blue ", "Green", "Red", "Orange"];
```


```JSX


   <Firefly
      canvasWidth={200}  // you can choose any positive width suitable for your purpose
      canvasHeight={300} // you can choose any positive height suitable for your purpose
      colors={colors}
   />


```

### Responsive
To make the canvas screen responsive, update the height and width of the canvas using `canvasHeight` and `canvaswidth` props.
Here is an example using react-hooks.

```JSX
const [canvasHeight, setCanvasHeight] = useState(window.innerHeight);
const [canvasWidth, setCanvasWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);

window.addEventListener(
   "resize",
   (e) => {
   setCanvasHeight(window.innerHeight);
   setCanvasWidth(window.innerWidth);
   },
   false
);



   <Firefly
      canvasWidth={canvasWidth} 
      canvasHeight={canvasHeight} 
   />



```
### Css styling 
Use className prop to assign an className to the component and apply any custom css accordingly.
```JSX
  <Firefly
      className='firefly-react-example-classname' 
   />

```

```CSS
.firefly-react-example-classname{
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  z-index:1
}
```

## Want to Contribute ?

Contributing to Open source is self rewarding and i love being part of it , if you too are excited about it , i would love to collaborate ‚ô•Ô∏è .
Currently we need help with :

- Using multithreading concepts to boost our canvas rendering
- particle pooling and hence performance optimization
- I do believe this project has immense potential to offer some good out there , so any proposal for new feature addition would be highly appreciated .
- Strong type checking and dynamic object validation would also make this library robust
